# My Personal Webpage (rbucinell.com)
This repo is the source code for my personal website [rbucinell.com](http://rbucinell.com), which is hosted by github pages. Deployed with github workflows.

## Building from source

This is a static site that is compiled by Astro.
Run the following commands to get started.

2. npm install
3. npm run dev

## Notes on pages
#### /projects.html
This is a dynamically built webpage. The script will iterate through my projects directory and create a json config file of all projects found. On page load the config file will be loaded and rendered as a list. If its a link then the hyperlink will be provided

#### /code.html
Just some old projects I've created, with download links and descriptions.

#### /flash.html
Flash is what got me into coding, so its bittersweet that its gone. While the projects dont run anymore, I've updated it to be a gallery of images for what they entailed.

#### /websites.html
Few sites I've stood up either for personal projects or freelance

#### /graphics.html
Originally a place to host my comptuer graphics homework. Ocassionally I add some phtoshop work.

#### /resume.html
The real reason the site exists at all, nice web version accompanied by a downloadable pdf
