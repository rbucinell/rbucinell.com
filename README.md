# My Personal Webpage (rbucinell.com)
This repo is the source code for my personal website [rbucinell.com](http://rbucinell.com), which is hosted by github pages. Deployed with github workflows.

## Building from source
This is a static site that is compiled by Astro.
Run the following commands to get started.

1. npm install

## Notes on pages

#### /resume
The real reason the site exists at all, nice web version accompanied by a downloadable pdf

#### /squares
Superbowl squares app that supports the board I run every year.

#### /code
Some of my more complete projects. Download and links inclueded on this page. Anything is in `/projects`

#### /projects
This is a dynamically built webpage. The script will iterate through my projects directory and create a json config file of all projects found. On page load the config file will be loaded and rendered as a list. If its a link then the hyperlink will be provided. These projects are in various states of incomplete and various experiments.

#### /websites 
AKA Freelance. Few sites I've stood up either for personal projects or freelance

#### /misc/xyz
Secondary pages will be under this sub directory

### Retired Pages
#### /flash
Flash is what got me into coding, so its bittersweet that its gone. While the projects dont run anymore, I've updated it to be a gallery of images for what they entailed.

#### /graphics
Originally a place to host my comptuer graphics homework. Ocassionally I add some phtoshop work.
