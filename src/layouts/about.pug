            p I am a Software Engineer and a father of twins. Currently living in Rochester, NY however Iâ€™m native to the area, however after getting BS in Computer Science I decided to stick around for the warm winters and Garbage plates. I am currently employed by Paychex on the Unified Communications team. Professionally I work on business automation, web services, and full-stack development. Most of my tools are internal or back end systems. Outside of my 9-5 I occasionally contract website development or script work.   For recreation I enjoy local sports leagues such as kickball, and softball.  I also moonlight as a referee for one of the leagues as well. I love doing mud-runs such as Tough Mudder, Warrior Dash (pictured to right), Spartan Sprint, and Hero Rush and the perpetual fear that I will be too out of shape to complete one keeps me going. Lastly I'm a huge movie buff and gamer, I'll happily discuss latest of either of these until long after the sun goes down.
