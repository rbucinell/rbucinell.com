            p I am a Software Engineer and a father of twins. Currently living in Rochester, NY however Iâ€™m native to the area, however after getting my bachelors in Computer Science I decided to stick around for the for the Garbage Plates. I am currently employed by Paychex working on business automation, web services, and full-stack development. Most of my tools are internal or back end systems.  Outside of my 9-5 I occasionally contract website development or script work.  
            p For recreation I enjoy plyaing in local sports leagues such as kickball, and softball even moonlighting as a referee for one of the leagues as well. I love doing mud-runs such as Tough Mudder, Warrior Dash (pictured to right), Spartan Sprint, and Hero Rush and the perpetual fear that I will be too out of shape to complete one keeps me going. Lastly I'm a huge movie buff and gamer, I'll happily discuss latest of either of these until long after the sun goes down.
