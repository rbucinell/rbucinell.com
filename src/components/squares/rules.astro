        <li class="italic text-blue-600">Why different numbers each quater? If the score doesn't change this means someone else will win. This will keep low score games more interesting and have more winners  </li>

            There is a statistical advantage to some numbers in the traditional scoring system. I am using a variance of the <a class="underline" href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fM0L9abY3bo/SZ0SfyPTF3I/AAAAAAAAAMw/1BU-JhoGR9o/s1600-h/graph.jpg">digital root</a> in order to create a more balance statistical distribution of a digit winning. In short, nobody should have "bad numbers" and its more fun for all.</li>
        <li>I reserve the right to remove unpaid square requests at any point before numbers are picked.</li>
        <li> Unclaimed/unpaid squares that win, will splash the payout </a>to the cardinal 4 directions in an equal payout (recursively until all money has been distributed)

        <li>If you have any problems picking squares, please text Jess or I. If you don't specify a square, or the square requested is taken we will pick the next sequentially availiable</li>
